# Vireca

> A Decentralized Data Protocol for Global Health Equity

Vireca is a Stellar-based protocol designed to empower patients by giving them sovereign control over their medical data. We believe that access to your health information is a fundamental right, not a privilege.

## üåê The Problem: Locked Data, Lost Potential

In today's digital world, critical health data is fragmented and inaccessible when it's needed most.

* **Trapped Data:** Health records are stuck in siloed hospital servers, making them non-portable and difficult for patients to access.
* **Emergency Inaccessibility:** Millions of people are unable to retrieve their own health data during critical emergencies, leading to potential risks.
* **Infrastructure Gap:** Developing nations often lack the multi-million dollar digital health infrastructure required for modern healthcare, widening the gap in global health equity.

## üí° Our Solution: Putting You Back in Control

Vireca leverages the power of the Stellar network to build a new paradigm. Our protocol allows patients to securely store their own medical records on-chain and share them with any doctor, anywhere in the world, in seconds.

The platform is **completely free for all patients**.

## ‚ú® How It Works: The User Experience

We are committed to making Web3 technology invisible and accessible to everyone. Our user experience is designed to be seamless.

**Passwordless. Walletless. Just You.**

* **Simple & Secure Login:** Using **Passkeys** technology (WebAuthn), your fingerprint or face becomes your key. There are no complex seed phrases to memorize or browser extensions to install.
* **Instant Sharing:** Patients can grant and revoke access to their data with a simple, intuitive interface, ensuring they are always in control.

## üìà Vision & Business Model: A Self-Funding Ecosystem

Vireca is designed to be a sustainable, self-funding ecosystem with a positive global impact.

Our business model is straightforward:
1.  **B2B Data Analytics:** Research institutions and pharmaceutical companies in developed countries subscribe to access **aggregated, fully anonymized health analytics** generated by the platform.
2.  **Subsidizing Global Access:** The revenue from these subscriptions is used to cover all network transaction fees for patients in developing countries.
3.  **Growth Engine:** A portion of the revenue is directed to the **Vireca DAO Treasury**, which finances the platform's continuous development, global expansion, and long-term maintenance.

This creates a **win-win-win** cycle where patients gain free access and data control, institutions get valuable insights for R&D, and the protocol grows sustainably.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features & Technology Stack

* **Built on Stellar:** We chose Stellar for its unique advantages that align with our global vision:
    * **Ultra-Low Costs:** Essential for subsidizing millions of free transactions globally.
    * **5-Second Transaction Speed:** Perfect for real-time data permissions and emergency access.
    * **Account Abstraction:** Natively supports revolutionary user experiences like Passkeys.
* **Data Sovereignty:** Patients have true ownership of their data. It's encrypted and only they can grant access.
* **Global & Interoperable:** Built for a borderless world, ensuring data is accessible wherever the patient is.

## Installation

### 1. Soroban Contract

First, you need to install Soroban CLI:

```bash
# Install Soroban CLI
cargo install --locked soroban-cli
```

To compile and deploy the contract:

```bash
cd contracts
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
soroban contract deploy --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/vireca_contract.wasm --source alice --network testnet
